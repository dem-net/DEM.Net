    /// For a point lying between 4 nearest grid coordinates, this interpolator will do a linear interpolation on X axis and then on Y axis.
    /// 
    ///
    /// 
    /// "The concept of linear interpolation between two points can be extended to bilinear interpolation within 
    /// the grid cell. The function is said to be linear in each variable when the other is held fixed. 
    /// 
    /// For example, to determine the height hi at x, y in Figure 5, the elevations at y on the vertical 
    /// boundaries of the grid cell can be linearly interpolated between h1 and h3 at ha, and h2 and h4 at hb.
    /// Finally, the required elevation at x can be linearly interpolated between ha and hb."
